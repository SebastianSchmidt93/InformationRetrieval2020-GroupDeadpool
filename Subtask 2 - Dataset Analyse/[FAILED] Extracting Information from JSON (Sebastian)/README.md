This is an attempt to extract the conclusion and premises from the JSON files of the dataset. 
In order to use this program, one has to put the JSON files into the same directory as the index.php, and use it via xampp, then accessing localhost in the browser adress bar.

Ultimately, while this code successfully managed to extract all the relevant information from four of the five JSON files, due to the lack of RAM, it failed to properly extract information from the biggest file, debateorg.json. As such, this coding attempt has been declared a failure for not managing to acquire all of the necessary information.
